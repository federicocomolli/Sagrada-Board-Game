### Project features

#### Game-specific requirements:  
* implemented all tool cards, from 1 to 12 (complete rules)  

#### Game-agnostic requirements:  
* implemented all requirements listed in the game-agnostic section  
* dynamic pattern cards (advanced functionality)  
* multiple matches (advanced functionality)  

We implemented both rmi and socket technology of communications. Each player can connect through  
its preferred technology and in one game, can disconnect itself and reconnect using the other technology.  
Users can play a game both in command line or in graphic user interface.
